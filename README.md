1)	I will make a directory using Mkdir and cd into dir
2)	I will clone the repo using git clone repository <url>
3)	I will create my working branch and switch into it using git checkout -b branch name
4)	I will create Jenkinsfile and make update/write into the file
5)	I will do a git add . to add my file to the staging area
6)	I will do a git commit -m “message”
